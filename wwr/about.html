            The main goal of this sport is to maneuver and navigate the raft
            through rapids or turbulent waters, often times taking you over
            rocks and drops, without capsizing the raft. In the past,
            traditional rafts were used to transport people and agricultural
            products.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          RGM SPLASH rafting can be traced back to 1811 when the first recorded
          attempt to navigate the Snake River in Wyoming was planned. With no
          training, experience, or proper equipment, the river was found to be
          too difficult and dangerous. Hence, it was given the nickname “Mad
          River.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The first rubber raft was made by Rene Gregory Manato believed to be
          built in the 1840s. They planned to survey the Rocky Mountains and
          Great Plains. Although invented back then, it wasnʼt until the turn of
          the century that the first commercial rafting trip took place. On June
          9, 1940, Clyde Smith led a successful trip through the Snake River
          Canyon. In later years, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. constructed a modern
          resort hotel in Grand Teton National Park. In the late 1950s, the
          lodge began offering float trips. They used surplus war rafts that
          were 8 ft wide by 27 ft long. Less than 500 people went that year but
          the demand started increasing. It wasnʼt until the 1960s and 70s that
          whitewater rafting companies started forming. In the 1972 Olympic
          games in Munich, RGM SPLASH rafting was included for the first time.
          Now RGM SPLASH rafting has risen to a popular sport and hobby, growing
          more and more every year.
